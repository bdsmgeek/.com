# BDSMGeek Rope

## Bird-Rope (Tori-Nawa/鳥 縄)

BDSMGeek has collaborated with the wonderful people at Birdhaus to bring you Bird-Rope,
our specially designed JBO free, scent free, all natural, responsibly sourced jute!

We work with the Koumanawa Company to source the finest fibers from Bangladesh, process them
with ethically sustainably sourced soybean oil instead of dangerous Jute Batching Oil, spin
them into rope with just the right amount of twist and tightness, all in good and fair working
conditions.

We import them to Canada to finally hand process and finish them with 100% Jojoba Oil and
Soybean Wax, so that you can get safe, strong, and comfortable rope to use in your intimate
practices.

Rope can be purchased at [Birdhaus](https://www.birdhausto.com/).

You can reach out to [me by email](mailto:bdsmgeek@gmail.com) with any inquiries about the rope.
