## Rope Safety

Rope bondage is not safe, it is considered "edge" play. Whoever is getting tied is in danger of many very real dangers to their health, from falling and breaking their teeth to nerve compression damage that can loose them their mobility and sensation in a limb.

Please do your own due diligence and take all of these resources as ways expand on a solid base of understanding. If possible in person lessons from professionals is highly recommend.

Always have a method to get your bottom out from the rope as fast as possible, note this not always requires cutting the rope but have safety sears or a rope knife at hand. I also recommend a Merlin spike for jammed knots.

I've taken to wearing a fanny pack around my waist with all my tools in it when I tie.

## Buying Rope

Local distributors will most of the time trump or match anything online so buy local if you can.

## Rope Care

Regular maintenance of rope will reduce the likelihood of a rope failing or having something go wrong with it as well as extend its life time.

My preferred maintenance routine is:

1. After using it, run the rope through your hand while applying pressure, this will cause the strands of the rope to even out over the length of the rope and prevent spots that might bunch and ultimately could result in high strands which comprises the integrity of the entire rope.
2. Oil your rope, I've been using mineral oil as my go to as it's mostly odorless, colorless and does not go rancid, another popular choice is jojobo oil but some people are allergic to it. to oil your rope, add oil to a rag, I've used denim and microfiber as they don't leave behind fibers and also tend to be durable enough to protect my hand from friction. ounce you have a decent amount of oil on the rag just repeat the first step pulling the rope through your rag.
3. Hang your rope, hanging your rope loosely or "resting it" allows for the tension into the strands to naturally even out. helping with the same issues from step 1.
4. Optionally you can wax your rope with beeswax or paraffin by pulling the rope through a block. I don't really do this.
