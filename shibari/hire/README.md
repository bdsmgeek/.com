# Professional Rope

Being passionate about shibari for over 10 years, including making and selling my own rope, after many pleasure photo-shoots and performances I debuted as a professional rigger at FloorPlay with YourWildestAngel on Oct 25th 2024 at the [FloorPlay](https://www.instagram.com/wefloorplay) party held at [Objx Studio](https://www.objx.studio/).

All inquiries can be sent to <bdsmgeek@gmail.com>

## Private Sessions

If you like what I do and are interested in doing some rope with me or just asking me questions and getting some mentorship, I'm available!

I charge $400 per hour plus space rental fees if applicable, this includes time for negotiation and aftercare if we are tying.

Full fee is expected upon booking.

If its your first time doing rope I highly recommend booking at least 2 hours to allow for enough time to have discussions and come down after.

If you're not sure where you fall or if you like rope, I am happy to take you to one of the Friday evening Introduction Classes at the [Toronto Kinbaku Salons](https://torontokinbakusalon.com/) and mentor you through the experience. The class is one hour and the cost for two people is $60 ([see website for most up to date costs and schedule](https://torontokinbakusalon.com/products/intro-classes-date-and-time-options)).

## Performances

I charge $600 for a 20 min performance with a model, this includes travel within Toronto, setup and tear down, as well as a up to 20 min Q&A and demo session.

A non refundable deposit of 50% of the fee is expected on booking, with the remaining 50% due on day of the event.

Every additional performance would be $400 up to a max of 2 additional performances with 30min breaks or to the comfort of the model.

I require a inspection of the site prior to the date of the event and reserve the right to refuse a performance if the site is not in workable condition or deemed unsafe.

I can bring my own suspension rig at an additional flat fee of $200.

## Photo-shoots

If you've been dreaming of capturing some moments that include rope in them I am happy to collaborate and make your vision come true!

I charge a base rate of $400, which includes travel within Toronto, and a $200 per hour after the first hour.

I can assist with sourcing of photographers, and models at their own individual rates for no extra charge.

Scope and limits will be determined by all parties involved, including use of media created.
